### 🌟 Key Takeaways:

> Human-centered AI design was a dominant theme. Speakers emphasized that ethical deployment, trust-building, and explainability are now just as important as model accuracy.

> AI is being shaped not just by data scientists, but by interdisciplinary teams, including psychologists, clinicians, ethicists, and UX designers, to better serve human needs.

> In sectors like life sciences, health diagnostics, and robotics, AI is transitioning from experimental to applied and regulated systems.

> A major shift is visible: from "can it be done?" to "should it be done, and how will it affect people?"

💬 “Innovation in AI must account for the human factor—not just in performance metrics, but in empathy, usability, and long-term trust.”
