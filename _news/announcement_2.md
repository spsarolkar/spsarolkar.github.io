Backpropagation, introduced in 1986, is a widely used and effective method for training neural networks, but it has drawbacks like high memory usage and limited parallelism. Researchers at the University of Oxford have now proposed a new algorithm that trains neural networks without relying on backpropagation, potentially overcoming these limitations.
