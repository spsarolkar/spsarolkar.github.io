Hi, I’m Sunil Sarolkar, a passionate and versatile software engineer with 14+ years of experience in designing and building enterprise-grade applications using Java, Spring, J2EE, and a wide range of modern technologies. I currently work as an Associate at Deutsche Bank, where I contribute to building secure, scalable, and cloud-ready financial applications.

In addition to my core Java expertise, I’m an avid explorer of emerging technologies, with hands-on experience in data science, machine learning, Spark, Kafka, and Python-based neural networks. I've successfully completed the CDS (Computational Data Science) certification from IISc Bangalore and built advanced projects including:

🤟 Indian Sign Language Translator: A neural translation system for ISL using Pose Estimation and Transformers (Live Demo)

🔁 StructFormer: A transformer-based system that translates structured validation errors into SQL adjustment queries with near 99% validation accuracy

🚗 Vehicle Telemetry Console: A Raspberry Pi + ELM327-based real-time dashboard for OBD-II car data, with Kafka-Spark based anomaly detection

This website is designed and developed by me using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. I constantly update it with new blog posts, projects, and experiments. Currently, I’m working on integrating a custom commenting feature and expanding this into a product platform for AI-assisted structured data transformation.

📫 Feel free to explore, connect with me on LinkedIn, or check out my code on GitHub.
