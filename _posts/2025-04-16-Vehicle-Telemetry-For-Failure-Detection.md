In 2019, I built a hobby project to collect real-time vehicle parameters from the **OBD-II port** using an **ELM327 Bluetooth adapter** and a **Raspberry Pi**. This setup allowed me to display **vehicle speed** and **RPM** on a custom instrument console. As a demonstration, the Raspberry Pi connected to the ELM327 via Bluetooth and parsed live vehicle data directly from the CAN bus.

The hardware flow looked like this:

- **Vehicle** ‚Üí ELM327 / CAN Bus
- **ELM327** ‚Üí Bluetooth ‚Üí **Raspberry Pi**
- **Raspberry Pi** ‚Üí Instrument Console (Python-based UI)

I have now planned to enhance the project with real-time streaming and anomaly detection:

- The Raspberry Pi connects to a **Kafka broker** using a **4G modem**.
- Vehicle telemetry data such as speed, RPM, coolant temperature, and throttle position is pushed to Kafka topics.
- These streams are processed using **Apache Spark**, and anomalies are detected with a trained **ML model**.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Components:

- ELM327 Bluetooth integration
- Real-time data collection on Raspberry Pi
- Custom instrument display for speed and RPM

## üîú Planned Enhancements:

- Kafka streaming pipeline with 4G modem
- Apache Spark for telemetry processing
- ML-based failure detection using vehicle health indicators

## Final Thoughts

This project connects the physical and digital world by capturing automotive telemetry and enabling intelligent, ML-based diagnostics. It's an exciting intersection of **IoT**, **machine learning**, and **real-time streaming**‚Äîa great example of applying data science beyond traditional dashboards.
